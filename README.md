# Vim with dependencies install script 

One-command LunarVim installation for Ubuntu/Debian (bash) and Windows (PowerShell), including all dependencies and recommended plugins.

---

## Why this project?

I created this script because, based on my own experience, setting up a complete, modern Vim/Neovim environment was always time-consuming and often frustratingâ€”especially when you want all the features working out-of-the-box. This installer takes care of everything for you: dependencies, plugin setup, configuration backup, and even verifying that all essential shortcuts work. Now, you can get a powerful IDE-like setup in your terminal in just one command, hassle-free!

## Local Installation

To install only for the current user, without administrator privileges, use the `-l` or `--local` flag:

```bash
./install.sh -l
```

**Local installation advantages:**
- No `sudo` or administrator privileges required
- Installs everything in `~/.local/` (doesn't affect other users)
- Automatically adds `~/.local/bin` to your PATH
- Perfect for environments where you don't have root access

**Local installation commands:**

```bash
# Option 1: Direct download and execution
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vhwcm/lvim-ultimate-installer/main/install.sh) -l

# Option 2: Download first, execute later
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vhwcm/lvim-ultimate-installer/main/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh -l
```
